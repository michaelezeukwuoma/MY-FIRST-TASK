<h1 style=text-align:center>WHY I WANT TO BE A WEB DEVELOPER</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Over the years, most things that deal with programming in the higher institution of learning have always been attributed to students in the computer science discipline; and this makes some students in other areas of study, who had interest in learning tech skills to be demoralized.</p>
<h3>My Thoughts and questions</h3>
One day, while I was just having thoughts about random things around me, I just asked myself a question, "why have the school authority chosen to bother us (geoscience students) with this computer science course, since all we are in school to do is to study the subsurface and utilize the things in it?" this really gave me much concern and made me to approach one of my lecturers to ask him if there is any need for a geoscientist having a knowledge of programming.</p> 

<h3>The answers to my question</h3>

<p>The reply that I got from the lecturer was really a very encouraging one; he told me that “apart from studying computer science in school, an undergraduate need to be proficient in one tech skill or the other; but as a geoscientist, if you can get a good knowledge about python programming, it’s really a very big plus for you because, geoscience is now advancing from the era where most of the works can be done with the help of softwares; it doesn’t end there, applying the knowledge of python programming in other areas that are not related to Geoscience (web design, mobile app development, game development, etc.) can really be a nice one for you, because it will make you to be versatile and improves your employability. Imagine applying to a geophysical company as a geophysicist(having web design skills too), when they enough geophysicist working with them, but seriously in need of a web designer who can handle their web page; being a proficient web designer will give you more chances to be employed as their web designer since there are no slots for field workers”</p>
<h3>The resolution</h3>

<p>After the discussion, I started having the feeling that being a geoscience student is not a barrier for me to learn programming, I started having the strong desire to learn python programming and use it for either data science or web development.</p>

<h3>My action</h3>
<p>I had to meet a senior colleague that is a friend of mine, who is already a programmer to help me with the necessary things I need to become a web developer; and Im happy that today, I already have web design in view, hoping to complete the course soon.</p>
