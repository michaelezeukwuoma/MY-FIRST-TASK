    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <p>What makes something a living thing? Life. A living thing has life in it and as such exhibits peculiar characteristics that differentiate it from a non-living thing What are these peculiar characteristics? First and foremost, a living thing could be a single unit of life (unicellular organisms, amoeba - animal-like, and chlamydomonas - plant-like) or a complex organization, eg, multicellular organisms. Plants and animals are typically examples of living things.

    <h3>CHARACTERISTICS OF LIVING THINGS
</h3>

<p>
    <h6>
    <u>-Nutrition:</u>
    </h6>
    Living things feed in order to stay alive. They make use of the energy obtained from food to carry out the various cellular activities. Animals obtain ready-made food from their surroundings while plants make their own food using inorganic substances and energy from sunlight. 
</p>


<p>
    <h6>
        <u>-Growth:</u>
    </h6>
    A living organism increases in size (height and weight). This is usually followed by developmental changes in abilities, form, response, etc
</p>
<p>
    <h6>
        <u>-Respiration</u>
        </h6>
        Respiration does not limit itself to breathing (gaseous exchange) alone. Living organisms release energy from the breakdown of food molecules within its body, i.e, it respires. Oxygen is needed for this process while carbondioxide is liberated as a waste product. 

</p>

<p>
    <h6>
        <u>-Movement:</u>
        </h6>
         A living organism moves its whole body or part of it. Animals, generally, move themselves from place to place (locomotion) while plants only move parts of their bodies in response to external stimuli.

<h3>CLASSIFICATION OF LIVING ORGANISMS AND NAMING 
</h3>
<p>
    In science, the practice of classifying organisms is called taxonomy (Taxis means arrangement and nomos mean method). The modern taxonomic system was developed by the Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus (1707-1778). He used simple physical characteristics of organisms to identify and differentiate between different species and is based on genetics. Linnaeus developed a hierarchy of groups for taxonomy. To distinguish different levels of similarity, each classifying group, called taxon (pl. taxa) is subdivided into other groups.
